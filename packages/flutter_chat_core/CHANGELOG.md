## 0.0.12

**⚠️ Breaking changes ⚠️**

- Updated the `Message` model to rename `parentId` to `replyToId`
- The `createdAt` field is now optional in the message model
- The `sending` field has been removed from the message model; instead, you can set `sending: true` in the metadata of the Message model to achieve the same functionality.
- The `isOnlyEmoji` property has been removed from the text message model; to indicate that a message contains only emojis, use `isOnlyEmoji: true` in the metadata of the text message.
- The `firstName` and `lastName` fields in the `User` model have been consolidated into a single `name` field for improved simplicity.

**Other changes**

- Introduced `MessageID` and `UserID` typedefs to provide clearer context, while maintaining their underlying type as `String`s
- Introduced `TextStreamMessage` type to support text streaming
- Added `textStreamMessageBuilder` to the `Builders` class to support text streaming UI widget

## 0.0.10

**⚠️ Breaking changes ⚠️**

- Requires Freezed 3.0.0
- Replace `status` field with a computed getter that determines message state based on lifecycle timestamps (`createdAt`, `deletedAt`, `sending`, `failedAt`, `sentAt`, `deliveredAt`, `seenAt`, `updatedAt`). This enables granular message history tracking and status transitions, matching the behavior of popular chat applications.
- Rename `overlay` to `hasOverlay` in `ImageMessage`

## 0.0.8

- Add `UserCache` class to store resolved users for synchronous access, preventing flickering in recycled widgets by caching user data with LRU eviction strategy
- Add `ScrollToMessageMixin` to enable programmatic scrolling in chat list:
  - `scrollToMessage(messageId)`: Scrolls to a specific message by ID
  - `scrollToIndex(index)`: Scrolls to a message at a specific index
  - Both methods support customizable animation duration, curve, alignment and offset
  - Can be used directly through any `ChatController` instance
  - See the pagination example in the example project for usage details
- Add validation to prevent duplicate message IDs

## 0.0.7

## 0.0.6

**⚠️ Breaking changes ⚠️**

## 0.0.5

**⚠️ Breaking changes ⚠️**

🔄 Core Changes:
- `author` (type `User`) is replaced with `authorId` (type `String`) for simpler user management
- All `DateTime` properties now use milliseconds instead of microseconds for JSON serialization

🎨 Theme Simplification:
Theme has been streamlined to 3 key parameters:
1. `colors` - Uses Material 3 semantic names (e.g. `primary`, `onPrimary`, `secondary`) making it easy to apply color schemes
2. `typography` - Follows Flutter's `TextTheme` semantic naming conventions
3. `shape` - Controls border radius of all messages (rounded vs square messages)

✨ Enhanced Customization:
- Individual widget customization available through the `builders` parameter
- Example: `loadMoreBuilder: (context) => LoadMore(color: Colors.red)` overrides theme colors
- Full widget customization possible by returning custom widgets from builders
