**⚠️ Breaking changes ⚠️**

## 0.0.5

**⚠️ Breaking changes ⚠️**

🔄 Core Changes:
- `author` (type `User`) is replaced with `authorId` (type `String`) for simpler user management
- All `DateTime` properties now use milliseconds instead of microseconds for JSON serialization

🎨 Theme Simplification:
Theme has been streamlined to 3 key parameters:
1. `colors` - Uses Material 3 semantic names (e.g. `primary`, `onPrimary`, `secondary`) making it easy to apply color schemes
2. `typography` - Follows Flutter's `TextTheme` semantic naming conventions
3. `shape` - Controls border radius of all messages (rounded vs square messages)

✨ Enhanced Customization:
- Individual widget customization available through the `builders` parameter
- Example: `loadMoreBuilder: (context) => LoadMore(color: Colors.red)` overrides theme colors
- Full widget customization possible by returning custom widgets from builders

- Message builders now include the message index in their parameters.
- Reverted `withValues` to `withOpacity` to resolve a compatibility issue.
